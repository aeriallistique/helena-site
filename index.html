        <h1 class="wtefac_h1">What to expect at a Totem class</h1>
        <h2 class="wtefac_header header">COVID-19</h2>
        <p>Due to the current situation with Covid-19, it would be extremely helpful
           if you would come with your child wearing their gymnastics leotard/active wearing
           underneath their clothes to ease with dropping off your child for the lesson.
           When you arrive, all adult visitors will be temperature tested and everyone will be asked
           to wash their hands. You will then be directed up the stairs where the class will take place.
           Durin these times, parents/carers will be asked to stay in their car or leave and return where possible.
           Masks are optional when entering the building but whilst the children are partaking in the session, no masks are advised to be worn.
           Sosical distancind will be ensured by creating stations that are used by one child at a time
           and adequately spaced out - where a cross over of equipment is needed, the equipment
           will be cleaned beforehand. As with all equipent prior to use will be clean before and after all sessions.
        </p>
        <h2 class="wtefac_header_1 header">So what will my child be learning at Totem Gymnastics?</h2>
        <p class="wtefac_para">No matter what age of the child, creating a safe, fun and friendly environment is the priority
           of the club.
           Sessions start with a fun and engaging warm-up inluding pulse raisers, stretches and conditioning exercises.
           Children will learn the fundamentals of gymnastics and improve flexibility and strength through
           a diverse and fun approach. All the sessions are different each week and we work
           on 4 areas of gymnastics, floor work, beam work, vault and bars.
           All sessions finish with a cool down and a big well done!
        </p>
        <h2 class="wtefac_header_2 header">How do you track your child's progress?</h2>
        <p class="wtefac_para">Here at Totem, we believe it's so important for every gymnast to be able to track their progress as well as parents/carers 
            to see your child's progress. Gymasts are assessed in the BAGA proficiency awards every 3 months, which is a 
            very in formal Assessment.
            This is the gymnasts opportunitty to showcase thei skills they have been learning
            in the sessions.
            To gain their badges, they have to 7 out of 10  skills on each badge to pass.
            This is a great encouragement for improving their skills and an amazing achievement
            for the gymnasts.

        <p> With over 8+years of teaching and coaching, dance and gymnastics, your children will love the fun and exciting class environment that is provided at Totem. I have been coaching for many years in various settings including schools, community centres, SEN centres, nurseries and even care homes. Having this range of teaching environments has allowed me to nurture my teaching styles and understand many teaching methods that are applicable when teaching a variety of children.  
            I have been a dancer all my life and after my BA Hons in dance and professional practice, I performed around the UK and Europe as a dancer. After performing, I took up teaching to support myself and found a huge passion for it. Since then I have achieved my Level 1 and Level 2 British Gymnastics qualifications which allows me to lead my own sessions. I’ve got a full DBS, available for all parents and I am first aid trained.</p>
